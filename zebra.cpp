Q1 Create a base class Animal with the following properties and methods:

a) name (string): The name of the animal.

b) species (string): The species of the animal.

c) age (int): The age of the animal.

d) sound() method: A virtual method that should be overridden by derived classes to make the specific sound of the animal.

Create two derived classes, Lion and Elephant, that inherit from the Animal base class. These classes should have their own implementations for the sound() method.

Implement a function printAnimalInfo() that takes an Animal object as an argument and prints the animal's name, species, age, and the sound it makes.

Create instances of both Lion and Elephant and use the printAnimalInfo() function to display their information.

Q2 You are building a simple calculator program that performs basic arithmetic operations. You want to ensure that the program handles exceptions gracefully, specifically when division by zero or when the user enters invalid input.

Q3 Write program to find Sum of real and imaginary numbers using with friend function.Also apply operator overlaoding concept(i.e. overload + opertor to perform addition).

Q4 Create a list and define function to add elements at the front and end of the list. Also make

another function to remove element in list.

Q5 John wants to write a program that requires the user to enter a username and password. The program should then read the user's input for the username and password and finally display the entered username and password but condition for password is:

password contains at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one digit, and is at least 8
characters long.

06 create a class to represent books and manage their information, Each book has a title, author, price, and a publication year. Your task is to design a Book class with appropriate constructors and methods to store and retrieve this information.

Requirements:

1.Create a Book class with the following private members:

title: The title of the book.

author: The author of the book.

price: The price of the book.

year: The publication year of the book.

2. Implement the following constructors for the Book class:

A default constructor that initializes the book with empty strings for title and author, a price of 0.0, and a year of 0. A parameterized constructor that takes all four book attributes as arguments to initialize the book.

object.

A copy constructor that creates a new Book object by copying the attributes from another Book

3. Implement getter methods to retrieve the values of the book's title, author, price, and year. 4.Create a method printInfo() that prints the book's title, author, price, and publication year.

Q7 Write a program that calculates the sum of positive numbers entered by a user while allowing the user to break the loop by entering a negative number.

Q8 Write a program to sort a vector of strings in both ascending and descending order using the std::sort function

Q9 Suppose you are developing a utility for a data analysis application. This utility needs to find the maximum value in an array of data points. However, the data points can be of various data types, such as integers, doubles, or floats. To make the utility as generic as possible, you decide to use a function template to find the maximum value in the array.

Q10 write a program to create a text file named "DummyFile"and also write "WELCOME LPU" in the file.NOW read data from file and print on console.
